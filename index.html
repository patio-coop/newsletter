      community
      organisations across Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.

    <blockquote>
      ‚ÄúAs we head into the more difficult winter
      months ahead, the mental health fallout from the financial difficulties many are expected to experience will be
      sharp. Many of the grants awarded will go directly to supporting vulnerable local people during this difficult
      time.‚Äù

    <p>
      For this alternative collective structure that we can <strong>build together</strong>, we have adopted the
      principles of equality,
      horizontal hierarchy, collective functioning, consensus based decision making, fair revenue sharing,
      decentralization, cooperation and solidarity. In this model, all individuals in the collective will be defined as
      workers and owners. Establishing the working order in any sector within a framework of these and similar other
      values may seem
      unrealistic to some, but examples all over the world that make those who read about say ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù, work and are not
      few. The change has already begun; <strong>international networks</strong> are being established! Knowledge,
      labour, time ‚Ä¶ When we
      combine them with organization and solidarity, a new order will emerge. We
      believe that, if we are the producers, we should be making the decisions and sharing the profit.

      ICA director general Bruno Roelants provided various examples of <strong>co-operation among co-operatives</strong>
      at last week‚Äôs
      UK Society for Co-operative Studies (UKSCS) annual conference. During his session, on 9 September, he set out the
      history of the principle, which was put into action much earlier than its first mention at the 1966 Vienna World
      Cooperative Congress. Mr Roelants, who has been leading the International Cooperative Alliance since 2018, said
      the establishment of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society in 1844 was soon followed by co-ops in other
      countries. Co-operators in Britain and other European countries started attending each other‚Äôs national
      <strong>co-operative congresses</strong> to exchange ideas. By 1893, preparations for an International
      Co-operative Alliance had
      already started; the decision to set it up was officially adopted at the 1895 Cooperative Congress in London.

        Historically, in <strong>WordPress</strong> development there have been no satisfactory workflows for including
        specific versions
        of plugins, themes or the WordPress core as dependencies in a new project.

        The result has been inefficiency: developers were forced to download and install these via Zip files or through
        the WordPress interface; it was slow to create repeatable builds and best development practice in terms of
        dependency management was not being followed.

        Feeling the need for better management of dependencies and looking to speed up project development, <strong>
          Outlandish
          created and open-sourced WPackagist</strong>.

        Now specific versions of plugins, themes and core can be declared by developers and included immediately when a
        new WordPress project is spun up, all pulled directly from the WordPress repository.

        The response from the WordPress community has been significant. WPackagist is now a core part of WordPress
        best-practice development, it‚Äôs frequently referenced in WordPress tutorials, conferences and WordPress books
        and the project on GitHub has numerous contributions by the WordPress community.

        Outlandish continue to manage the WPackagist venture and it‚Äôs usage speeds the build phases of all our WordPress
        client projects.

        <strong>NewsSocial</strong>, a multi-stakeholder co-op based in the UK, is aspiring to be the go-to social
        platform for
        co-operatives, change makers and citizens‚Äô assemblies.

        Available on the Apple and Google Play stores, the NewsSocial app enables users to exchange news, ideas and
        opinions. They can join different circles and sub circles and access information related to specific topics. The
        stories provide an incentive for evidence-based discussions among users, says founder Ali Shakir Al-Assam.

        ‚ÄúNewsSocial is built to provide a safe environment for evidence-based rational discussions and debates,‚Äù he
        adds, ‚Äúwith two main benefits: <strong>positive outcomes and good democratic governance</strong> supporting
        sociocracy, and an
        ecosystem for inter-co-operation with other users of the platform and community wealth building.

        Al-Assam has extensive experience in electronic publishing. In 1982 he set up Diwan-Science and Information
        technology, a tech social enterprise adhering to co-op principles that pioneered desktop publishing in Arabic.
        He left the company in 1995 to establish KnowledgeView, an enterprise focused on <strong>
          cross-media publishing, news
          management and editorial sharing systems
        </strong>. In 2014 along with other colleagues he set up Mushtarek C.I.C Social
        Enterprise to leverage methods and technologies to accelerate socio-economic change in Iraq, his country of
        birth. Mushtarek was the first to pilot the NewsSocial platform, and has attracted 500 users to date.

      The <strong>World Council of Credit Unions (Woccu)</strong> has published its Statistical Report for 2021,
      providing data on the
      global credit union movement.

      Through a global member survey, Woccu found that 81% of respondent credit union associations ranked <strong>
        digitisation
        at or near the top of their priorities
      </strong>. Around 66% identified membership and asset growth as another top priority,
      including 83% in Europe, 80% in Africa and 57% in Asia.

      Some credit unions were also concerned with regulatory reforms ‚Äì a priority for 51% and a top priority for
      respondent credit union associations in North America (100%) and the Caribbean (80%).

      The global credit union sector includes 87,914 credit unions across 118 countries, the report finds, with
      393,871,631 members and US$3.48tn in assets.

      Membership and assets growth vary across regions. Credit unions in Africa and Latin America saw the most
      substantial growth in terms of membership and assets while Europe witnessed a decline in assets and Australia and
      New Zealand both saw declining membership. Africa experienced the largest spike in assets ‚Äì 42% ‚Äì and Latin
      America witnessed the biggest growth in membership at 16%.
